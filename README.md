**Session Archive - Peer Grønnerup**

This repository contains materials from conference sessions, community talks, and webinars delivered personally by me on topics like Microsoft Fabric, Power BI, Tabular Editor, and related data platform topics.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a central, easy-to-navigate archive of session slide decks, sample code, scripts etc.

The structure is intentionally kept simple and intuitive, making it easy to find content without prior knowledge of the repository.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized by session type first, then by event or topic, and finally by year.
